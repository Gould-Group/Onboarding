# Meet Three People Blog

* **Goal**: Meet people and start to build your community
* **Timeline**: Within the three week of you joining the lab
* **Length**: Approximately 500 words

The goal of this blogging exercise is to help you build some connections with the researchers and staff members at the college.

The brief is very simple: **talk to three people and write about 500 words about those conversations**.

You can ask whatever questions you'd like, and you're welcome to chat with anyone you come across (except for current members of the Gould Group).

Some suggested questions could be:

* What is data science to you?
* What are your research questions?
* What do you like about working at the college?
* Who is your target audience?
* What are the most exciting parts of your job?

***You don't have to ask all of these questions!*** They're just suggestions to get you started.

It would be great to have some pictures of the people you speak with (remember to ask their permission!) and a little of your own voice and experience in the blog.
