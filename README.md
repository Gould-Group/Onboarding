# Onboarding
*This repo is heavily adapted from the Whitaker Lab's Onboarding procedure*

OH MY GOODNESS! You're here! You're really here!

How cool is that?! :sparkles: :balloon: :cake:

This is your jumping off point to get you up and running with your work in (or collaboration with) the Gould Group.

(It's currently a work in progress...I really hope you can shape and improve this onboarding experience as you learn!)

## Why onboarding

You're a person! (So am I!) We're social creatures (to varying degrees.) The traditional first day practice of giving new lab members a pile of papers and say "go read these and understand them" is rather isolating. It's difficult to read scientific papers in a field you don't know, and possibly isn't the best use of your first few days and weeks.

In this repository we're going to work through some tutorials, blogging exercises, reproducing some figures from papers and....so much more :wink:.

## Your first day

* Read the Gould Group [code of conduct](https://github.com/Gould-Group/Onboarding/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Chat with Ian if you have any questions about lab norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct.
* Ask [Tony](mailto:zy2414@ic.ac.uk) to invite you to join the Lab109 [slack channel](https://wc-lab109.slack.com).
* ***NOT YET IN PLACE/OPTIONAL*** Set up the weekly meetings file by following the guidelines in the [Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md](https://github.com/Gould-Group/Onboarding/blob/master/Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md) file.

## Lab meetings

The Gould Group meetings are approximately weekly from 10am to 11am on Fridays.
Members of the Gould Group are expected to join if they are able and to contribute to the agenda in advance of the meeting *whether they are able to attend or not*.

* Please read the [lab meetings](Lab-meetings.md) guide for more details.
You can find the specific dates of the meetings in the [Gould group calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tony.tc_m9r9c9cp1kacubeuttiu1vu07c%40group.calendar.google.com).

## Blogging exercises

One of the most useful ways for us to follow along with your progress is to read blog post summaries of what you've been working on. It's also a great way to share our work with others!

We'll set a schedule for each blog, but please plan on working through all four within the first few months of your time at the group.

0. [Introducing](BLOGGING_EXERCISES/00-Introducing.md)
1. [Meet 3 people at the college](BLOGGING_EXERCISES/01-MeetThreePeople.md)
2. [Blog about some code](BLOGGING_EXERCISES/02-BlogAboutSomeCode.md)
3. [Contribute to an open source project](BLOGGING_EXERCISES/03-OpenSourceContribution.md)
<!-- 4. [Goal setting](BLOGGING_EXERCISES/04-GoalSetting.md) -->

## Keep pushing

The only mandatory reading for this onboarding is [Matt Might's](http://matt.might.net/) [Illustrated Guide to a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/).
It's a beautiful description of the frustration and wonder of conducting reasearch.
Don't forget, whenever things are hard, ***keep pushing***.
