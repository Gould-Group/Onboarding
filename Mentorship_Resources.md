# Mentorship Resources

These are some great resources around mentoring and mentorship, they're here to help us all be on the same page as we work together.

> I'd like to describe an approach to choosing a project with a student (or for myself) that enhances self-determination. The goal is to choose a project that aligns with the student's unique set of skills and interests. It is a simple graphic called the TOP model (Figure 1). Imagine three circles. The first is T, for talents. The second is P, for passions, which intersects (but does not completely overlap) with T. The homework for the student is to list his or her talents and passions, even those that do not seem related to science. The final circle is O, objectives of the lab. The ideal project lies in the intersection of the three. This provides constraints that, as in all creative work, can lead you to unexpected and original projects.
